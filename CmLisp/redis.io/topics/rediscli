            <p><code>redis-cli</code> is the Redis command line interface, a simple program that allows
            to send commands to Redis, and read the replies sent by the server, directly
            from the terminal.</p>
            
            <p>It has two main modes: an interactive mode where there is a REPL (Read
            Eval Print Loop) where the user types commands and get replies; and another
            mode where the command is sent as arguments of <code>redis-cli</code>, executed, and
            printed on the standard output.</p>
            
            <p>In interactive mode, <code>redis-cli</code> has basic line editing capabilities to provide
            a good typing experience.</p>
            
            <p>However <code>redis-cli</code> is not just that. There are options you can use to launch
            the program in order to put it into special modes, so that <code>redis-cli</code> can
            definitely do more complex tasks, like simulate a slave and print the
            replication stream it receives from the master, check the latency of a Redis
            server and show statistics or even an ASCII-art spectrogram of latency
            samples and frequencies, and many other things.</p>
            
            <p>This guide will cover the different aspects of <code>redis-cli</code>, starting from the
            simplest and ending with the more advanced ones.</p>
            
            <p>If you are going to use Redis extensively, or if you already do, chances are
            you happen to use <code>redis-cli</code> a lot. Spending some time to familiarize with
            it is likely a very good idea, you&#39;ll see that you&#39;ll work more effectively
            with Redis once you know all the tricks of its command line interface.</p>
            
            <span id="command-line-usage" class=anchor></span><h1 ><a href="#command-line-usage" class=anchor-link>*</a>Command line usage</h1>
            
            <p>To just run a command and have its reply printed on the standard output is as
            simple as typing the command to execute as separated arguments of <code>redis-cli</code>:</p>
            
            <pre><code>$ redis-cli incr mycounter&#x000A;(integer) 7&#x000A;</code></pre>
            
            <p>The reply of the command is &quot;7&quot;. Since Redis replies are typed (they can be
            strings, arrays, integers, NULL, errors and so forth), you see the type
            of the reply between brackets. However that would be not exactly a great idea
            when the output of <code>redis-cli</code> must be used as input of another command, or when
            we want to redirect it into a file.</p>
            
            <p>Actually <code>redis-cli</code> only shows additional information which improves
            readability for humans when it detects the standard output is a tty (a terminal
            basically). Otherwise it will auto-enable the <em>raw output mode</em>, like in the
            following example:</p>
            
            <pre><code>$ redis-cli incr mycounter &gt; /tmp/output.txt&#x000A;$ cat /tmp/output.txt&#x000A;8&#x000A;</code></pre>
            
            <p>This time <code>(integer)</code> was omitted from the output since the CLI detected
            the output was no longer written to the terminal. You can force raw output
            even on the terminal with the <code>--raw</code> option:</p>
            
            <pre><code>$ redis-cli --raw incr mycounter&#x000A;9&#x000A;</code></pre>
            
            <p>Similarly, you can force human readable output when writing to a file or in
            pipe to other commands by using <code>--no-raw</code>.</p>
            
            <span id="host-port-password-and-database" class=anchor></span><h2 ><a href="#host-port-password-and-database" class=anchor-link>*</a>Host, port, password and database</h2>
            
            <p>By default <code>redis-cli</code> connects to the server at 127.0.0.1 port 6379.
            As you can guess, you can easily change this using command line options.
            To specify a different host name or an IP address, use <code>-h</code>. In order
            to set a different port, use <code>-p</code>.</p>
            
            <pre><code>$ redis-cli -h redis15.localnet.org -p 6390 ping&#x000A;PONG&#x000A;</code></pre>
            
            <p>If your instance is password protected, the <code>-a &lt;password&gt;</code> option will
            preform authentication saving the need of explicitly using the <a href="/commands/auth">AUTH</a> command:</p>
            
            <pre><code>$ redis-cli -a myUnguessablePazzzzzword123 ping&#x000A;PONG&#x000A;</code></pre>
            
            <p>Finally, it&#39;s possible to send a command that operates a on a database number
            other than the default number zero by using the <code>-n &lt;dbnum&gt;</code> option:</p>
            
            <pre><code>$ redis-cli flushall&#x000A;OK&#x000A;$ redis-cli -n 1 incr a&#x000A;(integer) 1&#x000A;$ redis-cli -n 1 incr a&#x000A;(integer) 2&#x000A;$ redis-cli -n 2 incr a&#x000A;(integer) 1&#x000A;</code></pre>
            
            <p>Some or all of this information can also be provided by using the <code>-u &lt;uri&gt;</code>
            option and a valid URI:</p>
            
            <pre><code>$ redis-cli -u redis://p%40ssw0rd@redis-16379.hosted.com:16379/0 ping&#x000A;PONG&#x000A;</code></pre>
            
            <span id="getting-input-from-other-programs" class=anchor></span><h2 ><a href="#getting-input-from-other-programs" class=anchor-link>*</a>Getting input from other programs</h2>
            
            <p>There are two ways you can use <code>redis-cli</code> in order to get the input from other
            commands (from the standard input, basically). One is to use as last argument
            the payload we read from <em>stdin</em>. For example, in order to set a Redis key
            to the content of the file <code>/etc/services</code> if my computer, I can use the <code>-x</code>
            option:</p>
            
            <pre><code>$ redis-cli -x set foo &lt; /etc/services&#x000A;OK&#x000A;$ redis-cli getrange foo 0 50&#x000A;&quot;#\n# Network services, Internet style\n#\n# Note that &quot;&#x000A;</code></pre>
            
            <p>As you can see in the first line of the above session, the last argument of the
            <a href="/commands/set">SET</a> command was not specified. The arguments are just <code>SET foo</code> without the
            actual value I want my key to be set to.</p>
            
            <p>Instead, the <code>-x</code> option was specified and a file was redirected to the CLI&#39;s
            standard input. So the input was read, and was used as the final argument for
            the command. This is useful for scripting.</p>
            
            <p>A different approach is to feed <code>redis-cli</code> a sequence of commands written in a
            text file:</p>
            
            <pre><code>$ cat /tmp/commands.txt&#x000A;set foo 100&#x000A;incr foo&#x000A;append foo xxx&#x000A;get foo&#x000A;$ cat /tmp/commands.txt | redis-cli&#x000A;OK&#x000A;(integer) 101&#x000A;(integer) 6&#x000A;&quot;101xxx&quot;&#x000A;</code></pre>
            
            <p>All the commands in <code>commands.txt</code> are executed one after the other by
            <code>redis-cli</code> as if they were typed by the user interactive. Strings can be
            quoted inside the file if needed, so that it&#39;s possible to have single
            arguments with spaces or newlines or other special chars inside:</p>
            
            <pre><code>$ cat /tmp/commands.txt&#x000A;set foo &quot;This is a single argument&quot;&#x000A;strlen foo&#x000A;$ cat /tmp/commands.txt | redis-cli&#x000A;OK&#x000A;(integer) 25&#x000A;</code></pre>
            
            <span id="continuously-run-the-same-command" class=anchor></span><h2 ><a href="#continuously-run-the-same-command" class=anchor-link>*</a>Continuously run the same command</h2>
            
            <p>It is possible to execute the same command a specified number of times
            with a user selected pause between the executions. This is useful in
            different contexts, for example when we want to continuously monitor some
            key content or <a href="/commands/info">INFO</a> field output, or when we want to simulate some
            recurring write event (like pushing a new item into a list every 5 seconds).</p>
            
            <p>This feature is controlled by two options: <code>-r &lt;count&gt;</code> and <code>-i &lt;delay&gt;</code>.
            The first states how many times to run a command, the second configures
            the delay between the different command calls, in seconds (with the ability
            to specify decimal numbers like 0.1 in order to mean 100 milliseconds).</p>
            
            <p>By default the interval (or delay) is set to 0, so commands are just executed
            ASAP:</p>
            
            <pre><code>$ redis-cli -r 5 incr foo&#x000A;(integer) 1&#x000A;(integer) 2&#x000A;(integer) 3&#x000A;(integer) 4&#x000A;(integer) 5&#x000A;</code></pre>
            
            <p>To run the same command forever, use <code>-1</code> as count.
            So, in order to monitor over time the RSS memory size it&#39;s possible
            to use a command like the following:</p>
            
            <pre><code>$ redis-cli -r -1 -i 1 INFO | grep rss_human&#x000A;used_memory_rss_human:1.38M&#x000A;used_memory_rss_human:1.38M&#x000A;used_memory_rss_human:1.38M&#x000A;... a new line will be printed each second ...&#x000A;</code></pre>

            <p>Mass insert using <code>redis-cli</code> is covered in a separated page since it&#39;s a
            worthwhile topic itself. Please refer to our
            <a href="/topics/mass-insert">mass insertion guide</a>.</p>
            
            <span id="csv-output" class=anchor></span><h2 ><a href="#csv-output" class=anchor-link>*</a>CSV output</h2>
            
            <p>Sometimes you may want to use <code>redis-cli</code> in order to quickly export data from
            Redis to an external program. This can be accomplished using the CSV (Comma
            Separated Values) output feature:</p>
            
            <pre><code>$ redis-cli lpush mylist a b c d&#x000A;(integer) 4&#x000A;$ redis-cli --csv lrange mylist 0 -1&#x000A;&quot;d&quot;,&quot;c&quot;,&quot;b&quot;,&quot;a&quot;&#x000A;</code></pre>
            
            <p>Currently it&#39;s not possible to export the whole DB like that, but only to run
            single commands with CSV output.</p>
            
            <span id="running-lua-scripts" class=anchor></span><h2 ><a href="#running-lua-scripts" class=anchor-link>*</a>Running Lua scripts</h2>
            
            <p>The <code>redis-cli</code> has extensive support for using the new Lua debugging facility
            of Lua scripting, available starting with Redis 3.2. For this feature, please
            refer to the <a href="/topics/ldb">Redis Lua debugger documentation</a>.</p>
            
            <p>However, even without using the debugger, you can use <code>redis-cli</code> to
            run scripts from a file in a way more comfortable compared to typing
            the script interactively into the shell or as an argument:</p>
            
            <pre><code>$ cat /tmp/script.lua&#x000A;return redis.call(&#39;set&#39;,KEYS[1],ARGV[1])&#x000A;$ redis-cli --eval /tmp/script.lua foo , bar&#x000A;OK&#x000A;</code></pre>
            
            <p>The Redis <a href="/commands/eval">EVAL</a> command takes the list of keys the script uses, and the
            other non key arguments, as different arrays. When calling <a href="/commands/eval">EVAL</a> you
            provide the number of keys as a number. However with <code>redis-cli</code> and using
            the <code>--eval</code> option above, there is no need to specify the number of keys
            explicitly. Instead it uses the convention of separating keys and arguments
            with a comma. This is why in the above call you see <code>foo , bar</code> as arguments.</p>
            
            <p>So <code>foo</code> will populate the <a href="/commands/keys">KEYS</a> array, and <code>bar</code> the <code>ARGV</code> array.</p>
            
            <p>The <code>--eval</code> option is useful when writing simple scripts. For more
            complex work, using the Lua debugger is definitely more comfortable. It&#39;s
            possible to mix the two approaches, since the debugger also uses executing
            scripts from an external file.</p>
            
            <span id="interactive-mode" class=anchor></span><h1 ><a href="#interactive-mode" class=anchor-link>*</a>Interactive mode</h1>
            
            <p>So far we explored how to use the Redis CLI as a command line program.
            This is very useful for scripts and certain types of testing, however most
            people will spend the majority of time in <code>redis-cli</code> using its interactive
            mode.</p>
            
            <p>In interactive mode the user types Redis commands at the prompt. The command
            is sent to the server, processed, and the reply is parsed back and rendered
            into a simpler form to read.</p>
            
            <p>Nothing special is needed for running the CLI in interactive mode -
            just lunch it without any arguments and you are in:</p>
            
            <pre><code>$ redis-cli&#x000A;127.0.0.1:6379&gt; ping&#x000A;PONG&#x000A;</code></pre>
            
            <p>The string <code>127.0.0.1:6379&gt;</code> is the prompt. It reminds you that you are
            connected to a given Redis instance.</p>
            
            <p>The prompt changes as the server you are connected to changes, or when you
            are operating on a database different than the database number zero:</p>
            
            <pre><code>127.0.0.1:6379&gt; select 2&#x000A;OK&#x000A;127.0.0.1:6379[2]&gt; dbsize&#x000A;(integer) 1&#x000A;127.0.0.1:6379[2]&gt; select 0&#x000A;OK&#x000A;127.0.0.1:6379&gt; dbsize&#x000A;(integer) 503&#x000A;</code></pre>
            
            <span id="handling-connections-and-reconnections" class=anchor></span><h2 ><a href="#handling-connections-and-reconnections" class=anchor-link>*</a>Handling connections and reconnections</h2>
            
            <p>Using the <code>connect</code> command in interactive mode makes it possible to connect
            to a different instance, by specifying the <em>hostname</em> and <em>port</em> we want
            to connect to:</p>
            
            <pre><code>127.0.0.1:6379&gt; connect metal 6379&#x000A;metal:6379&gt; ping&#x000A;PONG&#x000A;</code></pre>
            
            <p>As you can see the prompt changes accordingly. If the user attempts to connect
            to an instance that is unreachable, the <code>redis-cli</code> goes into disconnected
            mode and attempts to reconnect with each new command:</p>
            
            <pre><code>127.0.0.1:6379&gt; connect 127.0.0.1 9999&#x000A;Could not connect to Redis at 127.0.0.1:9999: Connection refused&#x000A;not connected&gt; ping&#x000A;Could not connect to Redis at 127.0.0.1:9999: Connection refused&#x000A;not connected&gt; ping&#x000A;Could not connect to Redis at 127.0.0.1:9999: Connection refused&#x000A;</code></pre>
            
            <p>Generally after a disconnection is detected, the CLI always attempts to
            reconnect transparently: if the attempt fails, it shows the error and
            enters the disconnected state. The following is an example of disconnection
            and reconnection:</p>
            
            <pre><code>127.0.0.1:6379&gt; debug restart&#x000A;Could not connect to Redis at 127.0.0.1:6379: Connection refused&#x000A;not connected&gt; ping&#x000A;PONG&#x000A;127.0.0.1:6379&gt; (now we are connected again)&#x000A;</code></pre>
            
            <p>When a reconnection is performed, <code>redis-cli</code> automatically re-select the
            last database number selected. However, all the other state about the
            connection is lost, such as the state of a transaction if we
            were in the middle of it:</p>
            
            <pre><code>$ redis-cli&#x000A;127.0.0.1:6379&gt; multi&#x000A;OK&#x000A;127.0.0.1:6379&gt; ping&#x000A;QUEUED&#x000A;&#x000A;( here the server is manually restarted )&#x000A;&#x000A;127.0.0.1:6379&gt; exec&#x000A;(error) ERR EXEC without MULTI&#x000A;</code></pre>
            
            <p>This is usually not an issue when using the CLI in interactive mode for
            testing, but you should be aware of this limitation.</p>
            
            <span id="editing-history-and-completion" class=anchor></span><h2 ><a href="#editing-history-and-completion" class=anchor-link>*</a>Editing, history and completion</h2>
            
            <p>Because <code>redis-cli</code> uses the
            <a href="http://github.com/antirez/linenoise">linenoise line editing library</a>, it
            always has line editing capabilities, without depending on <code>libreadline</code> or
            other optional libraries.</p>
            
            <p>You can access an history of commands executed, in order to avoid retyping
            them again and again, by pressing the arrow keys (up and down).
            The history is preserved between restarts of the CLI, in a file called
            <code>.rediscli_history</code> inside the user home directory, as specified
            by the <code>HOME</code> environment variable. It is possible to use a different
            history filename by setting the <code>REDISCLI_HISTFILE</code> environment variable,
            and disable it by setting it to <code>/dev/null</code>.</p>
            
            <p>The CLI is also able to perform command names completion by pressing the TAB
            key, like in the following example:</p>
            
            <pre><code>127.0.0.1:6379&gt; Z&lt;TAB&gt;&#x000A;127.0.0.1:6379&gt; ZADD&lt;TAB&gt;&#x000A;127.0.0.1:6379&gt; ZCARD&lt;TAB&gt;&#x000A;</code></pre>

            <p>It&#39;s possible to run the same command multiple times by prefixing the command
            name by a number:</p>
            
            <pre><code>127.0.0.1:6379&gt; 5 incr mycounter&#x000A;(integer) 1&#x000A;(integer) 2&#x000A;(integer) 3&#x000A;(integer) 4&#x000A;(integer) 5&#x000A;</code></pre>

            <p>Redis has a number of <a href="/commands">commands</a> and sometimes, as you test things,
            you may not remember the exact order of arguments. <code>redis-cli</code> provides online
            help for most Redis commands, using the <code>help</code> command. The command can be used
            in two forms:</p>
            
            <ul>
            <li><code>help @&lt;category&gt;</code> shows all the commands about a given category. The
            categories are: <code>@generic</code>, <code>@list</code>, <code>@set</code>, <code>@sorted_set</code>, <code>@hash</code>,
            <code>@pubsub</code>, <code>@transactions</code>, <code>@connection</code>, <code>@server</code>, <code>@scripting</code>,
            <code>@hyperloglog</code>.</li>
            <li><code>help &lt;commandname&gt;</code> shows specific help for the command given as argument.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>For example in order to show help for the <a href="/commands/pfadd">PFADD</a> command, use:</p>
            
            <p>127.0.0.1:6379&gt; help PFADD</p>
            
            <p>PFADD key element [element ...]
              summary: Adds the specified elements to the specified HyperLogLog.
              since: 2.8.9</p>
            
            <p>Note that <code>help</code> supports TAB completion as well.</p>

            <p>So far we saw two main modes of <code>redis-cli</code>.</p>
            
            <ul>
            <li>Command line execution of Redis commands.</li>
            <li>Interactive &quot;REPL-like&quot; usage.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>However the CLI performs other auxiliary tasks related to Redis that
            are explained in the next sections:</p>
            
            <ul>

            <span id="continuous-stats-mode" class=anchor></span><h2 ><a href="#continuous-stats-mode" class=anchor-link>*</a>Continuous stats mode</h2>
            
            <p>This is probably one of the lesser known features of <code>redis-cli</code>, and one
            very useful in order to monitor Redis instances in real time.
            To enable this mode, the <code>--stat</code> option is used.
            The output is very clear about the behavior of the CLI in this mode:</p>
            
            <pre><code>$ redis-cli --stat&#x000A;------- data ------ --------------------- load -------------------- - child -&#x000A;keys       mem      clients blocked requests            connections&#x000A;506        1015.00K 1       0       24 (+0)             7&#x000A;506        1015.00K 1       0       25 (+1)             7&#x000A;506        3.40M    51      0       60461 (+60436)      57&#x000A;506        3.40M    51      0       146425 (+85964)     107&#x000A;507        3.40M    51      0       233844 (+87419)     157&#x000A;507        3.40M    51      0       321715 (+87871)     207&#x000A;508        3.40M    51      0       408642 (+86927)     257&#x000A;508        3.40M    51      0       497038 (+88396)     257&#x000A;</code></pre>
            
            <p>In this mode a new line is printed every second with useful information and
            the difference between the old data point. You can easily understand what&#39;s
            happening with memory usage, clients connected, and so forth.</p>
            
            <p>The <code>-i &lt;interval&gt;</code> option in this case works as a modifier in order to
            change the frequency at which new lines are emitted. The default is one
            second.</p>
            
            <span id="scanning-for-big-keys" class=anchor></span><h2 ><a href="#scanning-for-big-keys" class=anchor-link>*</a>Scanning for big keys</h2>
            
            <p>In this special mode, <code>redis-cli</code> works as a key space analyzer. It scans the
            dataset for big keys, but also provides information about the data types
            that the data set consists of. This mode is enabled with the <code>--bigkeys</code> option,
            and produces quite a verbose output:</p>
            
            <pre><code>$ redis-cli --bigkeys&#x000A;&#x000A;# Scanning the entire keyspace to find biggest keys as well as&#x000A;# average sizes per key type.

            <p>In the first part of the output, each new key larger than the previous larger
            key (of the same type) encountered is reported. The summary section
            provides general stats about the data inside the Redis instance.</p>
            
            <p>The program uses the <a href="/commands/scan">SCAN</a> command, so it can be executed against a busy
            server without impacting the operations, however the <code>-i</code> option can be
            used in order to throttle the scanning process of the specified fraction
            of second for each 100 keys requested. For example, <code>-i 0.1</code> will slow down
            the program execution a lot, but will also reduce the load on the server
            to a tiny amount.</p>
            
            <p>Note that the summary also reports in a cleaner form the biggest keys found
            for each time. The initial output is just to provide some interesting info
            ASAP if running against a very large data set.</p>
            
            <span id="getting-a-list-of-keys" class=anchor></span><h2 ><a href="#getting-a-list-of-keys" class=anchor-link>*</a>Getting a list of keys</h2>
            
            <p>It is also possible to scan the key space, again in a way that does not
            block the Redis server (which does happen when you use a command
            like <code>KEYS *</code>), and print all the key names, or filter them for specific
            patterns. This mode, like the <code>--bigkeys</code> option, uses the <a href="/commands/scan">SCAN</a> command,
            so keys may be reported multiple times if the dataset is changing, but no
            key would ever be missing, if that key was present since the start of the
            iteration. Because of the command that it uses this option is called <code>--scan</code>.</p>
            
            <pre><code>$ redis-cli --scan | head -10&#x000A;key-419&#x000A;key-71&#x000A;key-236&#x000A;key-50&#x000A;key-38&#x000A;key-458&#x000A;key-453&#x000A;key-499&#x000A;key-446&#x000A;key-371&#x000A;</code></pre>
            
            <p>Note that <code>head -10</code> is used in order to print only the first lines of the
            output.</p>
            
            <p>Scanning is able to use the underlying pattern matching capability of
            the <a href="/commands/scan">SCAN</a> command with the <code>--pattern</code> option.</p>
            
            <pre><code>$ redis-cli --scan --pattern &#39;*-11*&#39;&#x000A;key-114&#x000A;key-117&#x000A;key-118&#x000A;key-113&#x000A;key-115&#x000A;key-112&#x000A;key-119&#x000A;key-11&#x000A;key-111&#x000A;key-110&#x000A;key-116&#x000A;</code></pre>
            
            <p>Piping the output through the <code>wc</code> command can be used to count specific
            kind of objects, by key name:</p>
            
            <pre><code>$ redis-cli --scan --pattern &#39;user:*&#39; | wc -l&#x000A;3829433&#x000A;</code></pre>
            
            <span id="pubsub-mode" class=anchor></span><h2 ><a href="#pubsub-mode" class=anchor-link>*</a>Pub/sub mode</h2>
            
            <p>The CLI is able to publish messages in Redis Pub/Sub channels just using
            the <a href="/commands/publish">PUBLISH</a> command. This is expected since the <a href="/commands/publish">PUBLISH</a> command is very
            similar to any other command. Subscribing to channels in order to receive
            messages is different - in this case we need to block and wait for
            messages, so this is implemented as a special mode in <code>redis-cli</code>. Unlike
            other special modes this mode is not enabled by using a special option,
            but simply by using the <a href="/commands/subscribe">SUBSCRIBE</a> or <a href="/commands/psubscribe">PSUBSCRIBE</a> command, both in
            interactive or non interactive mode:</p>
            
            <pre><code>$ redis-cli psubscribe &#39;*&#39;&#x000A;Reading messages... (press Ctrl-C to quit)&#x000A;1) &quot;psubscribe&quot;&#x000A;2) &quot;*&quot;&#x000A;3) (integer) 1&#x000A;</code></pre>
            
            <p>The <em>reading messages</em> message shows that we entered Pub/Sub mode.
            When another client publishes some message in some channel, like you
            can do using <code>redis-cli PUBLISH mychannel mymessage</code>, the CLI in Pub/Sub
            mode will show something such as:</p>
            
            <pre><code>1) &quot;pmessage&quot;&#x000A;2) &quot;*&quot;&#x000A;3) &quot;mychannel&quot;&#x000A;4) &quot;mymessage&quot;&#x000A;</code></pre>
            
            <p>This is very useful for debugging Pub/Sub issues.
            To exit the Pub/Sub mode just process <code>CTRL-C</code>.</p>
            
            <span id="monitoring-commands-executed-in-redis" class=anchor></span><h2 ><a href="#monitoring-commands-executed-in-redis" class=anchor-link>*</a>Monitoring commands executed in Redis</h2>
            
            <p>Similarly to the Pub/Sub mode, the monitoring mode is entered automatically
            once you use the <a href="/commands/monitor">MONITOR</a> mode. It will print all the commands received
            by a Redis instance:</p>
            
            <pre><code>$ redis-cli monitor&#x000A;OK&#x000A;1460100081.165665 [0 127.0.0.1:51706] &quot;set&quot; &quot;foo&quot; &quot;bar&quot;&#x000A;1460100083.053365 [0 127.0.0.1:51707] &quot;get&quot; &quot;foo&quot;&#x000A;</code></pre>
            
            <p>Note that it is possible to use to pipe the output, so you can monitor
            for specific patterns using tools such as <code>grep</code>.</p>
            
            <span id="monitoring-the-latency-of-redis-instances" class=anchor></span><h2 ><a href="#monitoring-the-latency-of-redis-instances" class=anchor-link>*</a>Monitoring the latency of Redis instances</h2>
            
            <p>Redis is often used in contexts where latency is very critical. Latency
            involves multiple moving parts within the application, from the client library
            to the network stack, to the Redis instance itself.</p>
            
            <p>The CLI has multiple facilities for studying the latency of a Redis
            instance and understanding the latency&#39;s maximum, average and distribution.</p>
            
            <p>The basic latency checking tool is the <code>--latency</code> option. Using this
            option the CLI runs a loop where the <a href="/commands/ping">PING</a> command is sent to the Redis
            instance, and the time to get a reply is measured. This happens 100
            times per second, and stats are updated in a real time in the console:</p>
            
            <pre><code>$ redis-cli --latency&#x000A;min: 0, max: 1, avg: 0.19 (427 samples)&#x000A;</code></pre>
            
            <p>The stats are provided in milliseconds. Usually, the average latency of
            a very fast instance tends to be overestimated a bit because of the
            latency due to the kernel scheduler of the system running <code>redis-cli</code>
            itself, so the average latency of 0.19 above may easily be 0.01 or less.
            However this is usually not a big problem, since we are interested in
            events of a few millisecond or more.</p>
            
            <p>Sometimes it is useful to study how the maximum and average latencies
            evolve during time. The <code>--latency-history</code> option is used for that
            purpose: it works exactly like <code>--latency</code>, but every 15 seconds (by
            default) a new sampling session is started from scratch:</p>
            
            <pre><code>$ redis-cli --latency-history&#x000A;min: 0, max: 1, avg: 0.14 (1314 samples) -- 15.01 seconds range&#x000A;min: 0, max: 1, avg: 0.18 (1299 samples) -- 15.00 seconds range&#x000A;min: 0, max: 1, avg: 0.20 (113 samples)^C&#x000A;</code></pre>
            
            <p>You can change the sampling sessions&#39; length with the <code>-i &lt;interval&gt;</code> option.</p>
            
            <p>The most advanced latency study tool, but also a bit harder to
            interpret for non experienced users, is the ability to use color terminals
            to show a spectrum of latencies. You&#39;ll see a colored output that indicate the
            different percentages of samples, and different ASCII characters that indicate
            different latency figures. This mode is enabled using the <code>--latency-dist</code>
            option:</p>
            
            <pre><code>$ redis-cli --latency-dist&#x000A;(output not displayed, requires a color terminal, try it!)&#x000A;</code></pre>
            
            <p>There is another pretty unusual latency tool implemented inside <code>redis-cli</code>.
            It does not check the latency of a Redis instance, but the latency of the
            computer you are running <code>redis-cli</code> on. What latency you may ask?
            The latency that&#39;s intrinsic to the kernel scheduler, the hypervisor in case
            of virtualized instances, and so forth.</p>
            
            <p>We call it <em>intrinsic latency</em> because it&#39;s opaque to the programmer, mostly.
            If your Redis instance has bad latency regardless of all the obvious things
            that may be the source cause, it&#39;s worth to check what&#39;s the best your system
            can do by running <code>redis-cli</code> in this special mode directly in the system you
            are running Redis servers on.</p>
            
            <p>By measuring the intrinsic latency, you know that this is the baseline,
            and Redis cannot outdo your system. In order to run the CLI
            in this mode, use the <code>--intrinsic-latency &lt;test-time&gt;</code>. The test&#39;s time
            is in seconds, and specifies how many seconds <code>redis-cli</code> should check the
            latency of the system it&#39;s currently running on.</p>
            
            <pre><code>$ ./redis-cli --intrinsic-latency 5&#x000A;Max latency so far: 1 microseconds.&#x000A;Max latency so far: 7 microseconds.&#x000A;Max latency so far: 9 microseconds.&#x000A;Max latency so far: 11 microseconds.&#x000A;Max latency so far: 13 microseconds.&#x000A;Max latency so far: 15 microseconds.&#x000A;Max latency so far: 34 microseconds.&#x000A;Max latency so far: 82 microseconds.&#x000A;Max latency so far: 586 microseconds.&#x000A;Max latency so far: 739 microseconds.&#x000A;&#x000A;65433042 total runs (avg latency: 0.0764 microseconds / 764.14 nanoseconds per run).&#x000A;Worst run took 9671x longer than the average latency.&#x000A;</code></pre>
            
            <p>IMPORTANT: this command must be executed on the computer you want to run Redis
            server on, not on a different host. It does not even connect to a Redis instance
            and performs the test only locally.</p>
            
            <p>In the above case, my system cannot do better than 739 microseconds of worst
            case latency, so I can expect certain queries to run in a bit less than 1
            millisecond from time to time.</p>

            <p>During Redis replication&#39;s first synchronization, the master and the slave
            exchange the whole data set in form of an RDB file. This feature is exploited
            by <code>redis-cli</code> in order to provide a remote backup facility, that allows to
            transfer an RDB file from any Redis instance to the local computer running
            <code>redis-cli</code>. To use this mode, call the CLI with the <code>--rdb &lt;dest-filename&gt;</code>
            option:</p>
            
            <pre><code>$ redis-cli --rdb /tmp/dump.rdb&#x000A;SYNC sent to master, writing 13256 bytes to &#39;/tmp/dump.rdb&#39;&#x000A;Transfer finished with success.&#x000A;</code></pre>
            
            <p>This is a simple but effective way to make sure you have disaster recovery
            RDB backups of your Redis instance. However when using this options in
            scripts or <code>cron</code> jobs, make sure to check the return value of the command.
            If it is non zero, an error occurred like in the following example:</p>
            
            <pre><code>$ redis-cli --rdb /tmp/dump.rdb&#x000A;SYNC with master failed: -ERR Can&#39;t SYNC while not connected with my master&#x000A;$ echo $?&#x000A;1&#x000A;</code></pre>
            
            <span id="slave-mode" class=anchor></span><h2 ><a href="#slave-mode" class=anchor-link>*</a>Slave mode</h2>
            
            <p>The slave mode of the CLI is an advanced feature useful for
            Redis developers and for debugging operations.
            It allows to inspect what a master sends to its slaves in the replication
            stream in order to propagate the writes to its replicas. The option
            name is simply <code>--slave</code>. This is how it works:</p>
            
            <pre><code>$ redis-cli --slave&#x000A;SYNC with master, discarding 13256 bytes of bulk transfer...&#x000A;SYNC done. Logging commands from master.&#x000A;&quot;PING&quot;&#x000A;&quot;SELECT&quot;,&quot;0&quot;&#x000A;&quot;set&quot;,&quot;foo&quot;,&quot;bar&quot;&#x000A;&quot;PING&quot;&#x000A;&quot;incr&quot;,&quot;mycounter&quot;&#x000A;</code></pre>
            
            <p>The command begins by discarding the RDB file of the first synchronization
            and then logs each command received as in CSV format.</p>
            
            <p>If you think some of the commands are not replicated correctly in your slaves
            this is a good way to check what&#39;s happening, and also useful information
            in order to improve the bug report.</p>
            
            <span id="performing-an-lru-simulation" class=anchor></span><h2 ><a href="#performing-an-lru-simulation" class=anchor-link>*</a>Performing an LRU simulation</h2>
            
            <p>Redis is often used as a cache with <a href="/topics/lru-cache">LRU eviction</a>.
            Depending on the number of keys and the amount of memory allocated for the
            cache (specified via the <code>maxmemory</code> directive), the amount of cache hits
            and misses will change. Sometimes, simulating the rate of hits is very
            useful to correctly provision your cache.</p>
            
            <p>The CLI has a special mode where it performs a simulation of GET and SET
            operations, using an 80-20% power law distribution in the requests pattern.
            This means that 20% of keys will be requested 80% of times, which is a
            common distribution in caching scenarios.</p>
            
            <p>Theoretically, given the distribution of the requests and the Redis memory
            overhead, it should be possible to compute the hit rate analytically with
            with a mathematical formula. However, Redis can be configured with
            different LRU settings (number of samples) and LRU&#39;s implementation, which
            is approximated in Redis, changes a lot between different versions. Similarly
            the amount of memory per key may change between versions. That is why this
            tool was built: its main motivation was for testing the quality of Redis&#39; LRU
            implementation, but now is also useful in for testing how a given version 
            behaves with the settings you had in mind for your deployment.</p>
            
            <p>In order to use this mode, you need to specify the amount of keys
            in the test. You also need to configure a <code>maxmemory</code> setting that 
            makes sense as a first try.</p>
            
            <p>IMPORTANT NOTE: Configuring the <code>maxmemory</code> setting in the Redis configuration
            is crucial: if there is no cap to the maximum memory usage, the hit will
            eventually be 100% since all the keys can be stored in memory. Or if you
            specify too many keys and no maximum memory, eventually all the computer
            RAM will be used. It is also needed to configure an appropriate
            <em>maxmemory policy</em>, most of the times what you want is <code>allkeys-lru</code>.</p>
            
            <p>In the following example I configured a memory limit of 100MB, and an LRU
            simulation using 10 million keys.</p>
            
            <p>WARNING: the test uses pipelining and will stress the server, don&#39;t use it
            with production instances.</p>
            
            <pre><code>$ ./redis-cli --lru-test 10000000&#x000A;156000 Gets/sec | Hits: 4552 (2.92%) | Misses: 151448 (97.08%)&#x000A;153750 Gets/sec | Hits: 12906 (8.39%) | Misses: 140844 (91.61%)&#x000A;159250 Gets/sec | Hits: 21811 (13.70%) | Misses: 137439 (86.30%)&#x000A;151000 Gets/sec | Hits: 27615 (18.29%) | Misses: 123385 (81.71%)&#x000A;145000 Gets/sec | Hits: 32791 (22.61%) | Misses: 112209 (77.39%)&#x000A;157750 Gets/sec | Hits: 42178 (26.74%) | Misses: 115572 (73.26%)&#x000A;154500 Gets/sec | Hits: 47418 (30.69%) | Misses: 107082 (69.31%)&#x000A;151250 Gets/sec | Hits: 51636 (34.14%) | Misses: 99614 (65.86%)&#x000A;</code></pre>
            
            <p>The program shows stats every second. As you see, in the first seconds
            the cache starts to be populated. The misses rate later stabilizes into
            the actual figure we can expect in the long time:</p>
            
            <pre><code>120750 Gets/sec | Hits: 48774 (40.39%) | Misses: 71976 (59.61%)&#x000A;122500 Gets/sec | Hits: 49052 (40.04%) | Misses: 73448 (59.96%)&#x000A;127000 Gets/sec | Hits: 50870 (40.06%) | Misses: 76130 (59.94%)&#x000A;124250 Gets/sec | Hits: 50147 (40.36%) | Misses: 74103 (59.64%)&#x000A;</code></pre>
            
            <p>A miss rage of 59% may not be acceptable for our use case. So we know that
            100MB of memory are no enough. Let&#39;s try with half gigabyte. After a few
            minutes we&#39;ll see the output to stabilize to the following figures:</p>
            
            <pre><code>140000 Gets/sec | Hits: 135376 (96.70%) | Misses: 4624 (3.30%)&#x000A;141250 Gets/sec | Hits: 136523 (96.65%) | Misses: 4727 (3.35%)&#x000A;140250 Gets/sec | Hits: 135457 (96.58%) | Misses: 4793 (3.42%)&#x000A;140500 Gets/sec | Hits: 135947 (96.76%) | Misses: 4553 (3.24%)&#x000A;</code></pre>
            
            <p>So we know that with 500MB we are going well enough for our number of
            keys (10 millions) and distribution (80-20 style).</p>
