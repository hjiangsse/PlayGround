            <span id="secondary-indexing-with-redis" class=anchor></span><h1 ><a href="#secondary-indexing-with-redis" class=anchor-link>*</a>Secondary indexing with Redis</h1>
            
            <p>Redis is not exactly a key-value store, since values can be complex data structures. However it has an external key-value shell: at API level data is addressed by the key name. It is fair to say that, natively, Redis only offers <em>primary key access</em>. However since Redis is a data structures server, its capabilities can be used for indexing, in order to create secondary indexes of different kinds, including composite (multi-column) indexes.</p>
            
            <p>This document explains how it is possible to create indexes in Redis using the following data structures:</p>
            
            <ul>
            <li>Sorted sets to create secondary indexes by ID or other numerical fields.</li>
            <li>Sorted sets with lexicographical ranges for creating more advanced secondary indexes, composite indexes and graph traversal indexes.</li>
            <li>Sets for creating random indexes.</li>
            <li>Lists for creating simple iterable indexes and last N items indexes.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>Implementing and maintaining indexes with Redis is an advanced topic, so most
            users that need to perform complex queries on data should understand if they
            are better served by a relational store. However often, especially in caching
            scenarios, there is the explicit need to store indexed data into Redis in order to speedup common queries which require some form of indexing in order to be executed.</p>
            
            <span id="simple-numerical-indexes-with-sorted-sets" class=anchor></span><h1 ><a href="#simple-numerical-indexes-with-sorted-sets" class=anchor-link>*</a>Simple numerical indexes with sorted sets</h1>
            
            <p>The simplest secondary index you can create with Redis is by using the
            sorted set data type, which is a data structure representing a set of
            elements ordered by a floating point number which is the <em>score</em> of
            each element. Elements are ordered from the smallest to the highest score.</p>
            
            <p>Since the score is a double precision float, indexes you can build with
            vanilla sorted sets are limited to things where the indexing field is a number
            within a given range.</p>
            
            <p>The two commands to build these kind of indexes are <a href="/commands/zadd">ZADD</a> and
            <a href="/commands/zrangebyscore">ZRANGEBYSCORE</a> to respectively add items and retrieve items within a
            specified range.</p>
            
            <p>For instance, it is possible to index a set of person names by their
            age by adding element to a sorted set. The element will be the name of the
            person and the score will be the age.</p>
            
            <pre><code>ZADD myindex 25 Manuel&#x000A;ZADD myindex 18 Anna&#x000A;ZADD myindex 35 Jon&#x000A;ZADD myindex 67 Helen&#x000A;</code></pre>
            
            <p>In order to retrieve all persons with an age between 20 and 40, the following
            command can be used:</p>
            
            <pre><code>ZRANGEBYSCORE myindex 20 40&#x000A;1) &quot;Manuel&quot;&#x000A;2) &quot;Jon&quot;&#x000A;</code></pre>
            
            <p>By using the <strong>WITHSCORES</strong> option of <a href="/commands/zrangebyscore">ZRANGEBYSCORE</a> it is also possible
            to obtain the scores associated with the returned elements.</p>
            
            <p>The <a href="/commands/zcount">ZCOUNT</a> command can be used in order to retrieve the number of elements
            within a given range, without actually fetching the elements, which is also
            useful, especially given the fact the operation is executed in logarithmic
            time regardless of the size of the range.</p>
            
            <p>Ranges can be inclusive or exclusive, please refer to the <a href="/commands/zrangebyscore">ZRANGEBYSCORE</a>
            command documentation for more information.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Note</strong>: Using the <a href="/commands/zrevrangebyscore">ZREVRANGEBYSCORE</a> it is possible to query a range in
            reversed order, which is often useful when data is indexed in a given
            direction (ascending or descending) but we want to retrieve information
            the other way around.</p>
            
            <span id="using-objects-ids-as-associated-values" class=anchor></span><h2 ><a href="#using-objects-ids-as-associated-values" class=anchor-link>*</a>Using objects IDs as associated values</h2>
            
            <p>In the above example we associated names to ages. However in general we
            may want to index some field of an object which is stored elsewhere.
            Instead of using the sorted set value directly to store the data associated
            with the indexed field, it is possible to store just the ID of the object.</p>
            
            <p>For example I may have Redis hashes representing users. Each user is
            represented by a single key, directly accessible by ID:</p>
            
            <pre><code>HMSET user:1 id 1 username antirez ctime 1444809424 age 38&#x000A;HMSET user:2 id 2 username maria ctime 1444808132 age 42&#x000A;HMSET user:3 id 3 username jballard ctime 1443246218 age 33&#x000A;</code></pre>
            
            <p>If I want to create an index in order to query users by their age, I
            could do:</p>
            
            <pre><code>ZADD user.age.index 38 1&#x000A;ZADD user.age.index 42 2&#x000A;ZADD user.age.index 33 3&#x000A;</code></pre>
            
            <p>This time the value associated with the score in the sorted set is the
            ID of the object. So once I query the index with <a href="/commands/zrangebyscore">ZRANGEBYSCORE</a> I&#39;ll
            also have to retrieve the information I need with <a href="/commands/hgetall">HGETALL</a> or similar
            commands. The obvious advantage is that objects can change without touching
            the index, as long as we don&#39;t change the indexed field.</p>
            
            <p>In the next examples we&#39;ll almost always use IDs as values associated with
            the index, since this is usually the more sounding design, with a few
            exceptions.</p>
            
            <span id="updating-simple-sorted-set-indexes" class=anchor></span><h2 ><a href="#updating-simple-sorted-set-indexes" class=anchor-link>*</a>Updating simple sorted set indexes</h2>
            
            <p>Often we index things which change over time. In the above
            example, the age of the user changes every year. In such a case it would
            make sense to use the birth date as index instead of the age itself,
            but there are other cases where we simple want some field to change from
            time to time, and the index to reflect this change.</p>
            
            <p>The <a href="/commands/zadd">ZADD</a> command makes updating simple indexes a very trivial operation
            since re-adding back an element with a different score and the same value
            will simply update the score and move the element at the right position,
            so if the user <code>antirez</code> turned 39 years old, in order to update the
            data in the hash representing the user, and in the index as well, we need
            to execute the following two commands:</p>
            
            <pre><code>HSET user:1 age 39&#x000A;ZADD user.age.index 39 1&#x000A;</code></pre>
            
            <p>The operation may be wrapped in a <a href="/commands/multi">MULTI</a>/<a href="/commands/exec">EXEC</a> transaction in order to
            make sure both fields are updated or none.</p>
            
            <span id="turning-multi-dimensional-data-into-linear-data" class=anchor></span><h2 ><a href="#turning-multi-dimensional-data-into-linear-data" class=anchor-link>*</a>Turning multi dimensional data into linear data</h2>
            
            <p>Indexes created with sorted sets are able to index only a single numerical
            value. Because of this you may think it is impossible to index something
            which has multiple dimensions using this kind of indexes, but actually this
            is not always true. If you can efficiently represent something
            multi-dimensional in a linear way, they it is often possible to use a simple
            sorted set for indexing.</p>
            
            <p>For example the <a href="/commands/geoadd">Redis geo indexing API</a> uses a sorted
            set to index places by latitude and longitude using a technique called
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geohash">Geo hash</a>. The sorted set score
            represents alternating bits of longitude and latitude, so that we map the
            linear score of a sorted set to many small <em>squares</em> in the earth surface.
            By doing an 8+1 style center plus neighborhoods search it is possible to
            retrieve elements by radius.</p>
            
            <span id="limits-of-the-score" class=anchor></span><h2 ><a href="#limits-of-the-score" class=anchor-link>*</a>Limits of the score</h2>
            
            <p>Sorted set elements scores are double precision integers. It means that
            they can represent different decimal or integer values with different
            errors, because they use an exponential representation internally.
            However what is interesting for indexing purposes is that the score is
            always able to represent without any error numbers between -9007199254740992
            and 9007199254740992, which is <code>-/+ 2^53</code>.</p>
            
            <p>When representing much larger numbers, you need a different form of indexing
            that is able to index numbers at any precision, called a lexicographical
            index.</p>
            
            <span id="lexicographical-indexes" class=anchor></span><h1 ><a href="#lexicographical-indexes" class=anchor-link>*</a>Lexicographical indexes</h1>
            
            <p>Redis sorted sets have an interesting property. When elements are added
            with the same score, they are sorted lexicographically, comparing the
            strings as binary data with the <code>memcmp()</code> function.</p>
            
            <p>For people that don&#39;t know the C language nor the <code>memcmp</code> function, what
            it means is that elements with the same score are sorted comparing the
            raw values of their bytes, byte after byte. If the first byte is the same,
            the second is checked and so forth. If the common prefix of two strings is
            the same then the longer string is considered the greater of the two,
            so &quot;foobar&quot; is greater than &quot;foo&quot;.</p>
            
            <p>There are commands such as <a href="/commands/zrangebylex">ZRANGEBYLEX</a> and <a href="/commands/zlexcount">ZLEXCOUNT</a> that
            are able to query and count ranges in a lexicographically fashion, assuming
            they are used with sorted sets where all the elements have the same score.</p>
            
            <p>This Redis feature is basically equivalent to a <code>b-tree</code> data structure which
            is often used in order to implement indexes with traditional databases.
            As you can guess, because of this, it is possible to use this Redis data
            structure in order to implement pretty fancy indexes.</p>
            
            <p>Before we dive into using lexicographical indexes, let&#39;s check how
            sorted sets behave in this special mode of operation. Since we need to
            add elements with the same score, we&#39;ll always use the special score of
            zero.</p>
            
            <pre><code>ZADD myindex 0 baaa&#x000A;ZADD myindex 0 abbb&#x000A;ZADD myindex 0 aaaa&#x000A;ZADD myindex 0 bbbb&#x000A;</code></pre>
            
            <p>Fetching all the elements from the sorted set immediately reveals that they
            are ordered lexicographically.</p>
            
            <pre><code>ZRANGE myindex 0 -1&#x000A;1) &quot;aaaa&quot;&#x000A;2) &quot;abbb&quot;&#x000A;3) &quot;baaa&quot;&#x000A;4) &quot;bbbb&quot;&#x000A;</code></pre>
            
            <p>Now we can use <a href="/commands/zrangebylex">ZRANGEBYLEX</a> in order to perform range queries.</p>
            
            <pre><code>ZRANGEBYLEX myindex [a (b&#x000A;1) &quot;aaaa&quot;&#x000A;2) &quot;abbb&quot;&#x000A;</code></pre>
            
            <p>Note that in the range queries we prefixed the <code>min</code> and <code>max</code> elements
            identifying the range with the special characters <code>[</code> and <code>(</code>.
            This prefixes are mandatory, and they specify if the elements
            of the range are inclusive or exclusive. So the range <code>[a (b</code> means give me
            all the elements lexicographically between <code>a</code> inclusive and <code>b</code> exclusive,
            which are all the elements starting with <code>a</code>.</p>
            
            <p>There are also two more special characters indicating the infinitely negative
            string and the infinitely positive string, which are <code>-</code> and <code>+</code>.</p>
            
            <pre><code>ZRANGEBYLEX myindex [b +&#x000A;1) &quot;baaa&quot;&#x000A;2) &quot;bbbb&quot;&#x000A;</code></pre>
            
            <p>That&#39;s it basically. Let&#39;s see how to use these features to build indexes.</p>
            
            <span id="a-first-example-completion" class=anchor></span><h2 ><a href="#a-first-example-completion" class=anchor-link>*</a>A first example: completion</h2>
            
            <p>An interesting application of indexing is completion. Completion is what
            happens when you start typing your query into a search engine: the user
            interface will anticipate what you are likely typing, providing common
            queries that start with the same characters.</p>
            
            <p>A naive approach to completion is to just add every single query we
            get from the user into the index. For example if the user searches <code>banana</code>
            we&#39;ll just do:</p>
            
            <pre><code>ZADD myindex 0 banana&#x000A;</code></pre>
            
            <p>And so forth for each search query ever encountered. Then when we want to
            complete the user input, we execute a range query using <a href="/commands/zrangebylex">ZRANGEBYLEX</a>.
            Imagine the user is typing &quot;bit&quot; inside the search form, and we want to
            offer possible search keywords starting for &quot;bit&quot;. We send Redis a command
            like that:</p>
            
            <pre><code>ZRANGEBYLEX myindex &quot;[bit&quot; &quot;[bit\xff&quot;&#x000A;</code></pre>
            
            <p>Basically we create a range using the string the user is typing right now
            as start, and the same string plus a trailing byte set to 255, which is <code>\xff</code> in the example, as the end of the range. This way we get all the strings that start for the string the user is typing.</p>
            
            <p>Note that we don&#39;t want too many items returned, so we may use the <strong>LIMIT</strong> option in order to reduce the number of results.</p>
            
            <span id="adding-frequency-into-the-mix" class=anchor></span><h2 ><a href="#adding-frequency-into-the-mix" class=anchor-link>*</a>Adding frequency into the mix</h2>
            
            <p>The above approach is a bit naive, because all the user searches are the same
            in this way. In a real system we want to complete strings according to their
            frequency: very popular searches will be proposed with an higher probability
            compared to search strings typed very rarely.</p>
            
            <p>In order to implement something which depends on the frequency, and at the
            same time automatically adapts to future inputs, by purging searches that
            are no longer popular, we can use a very simple <em>streaming algorithm</em>.</p>
            
            <p>To start, we modify our index in order to store not just the search term,
            but also the frequency the term is associated with. So instead of just adding
            <code>banana</code> we add <code>banana:1</code>, where 1 is the frequency.</p>
            
            <pre><code>ZADD myindex 0 banana:1&#x000A;</code></pre>
            
            <p>We also need logic in order to increment the index if the search term
            already exists in the index, so what we&#39;ll actually do is something like
            that:</p>
            
            <pre><code>ZRANGEBYLEX myindex &quot;[banana:&quot; + LIMIT 1 1&#x000A;1) &quot;banana:1&quot;&#x000A;</code></pre>
            
            <p>This will return the single entry of <code>banana</code> if it exists. Then we
            can increment the associated frequency and send the following two
            commands:</p>
            
            <pre><code>ZREM myindex 0 banana:1&#x000A;ZADD myindex 0 banana:2&#x000A;</code></pre>
            
            <p>Note that because it is possible that there are concurrent updates, the
            above three commands should be send via a <a href="/commands/eval">Lua script</a>
            instead, so that the Lua script will atomically get the old count and
            re-add the item with incremented score.</p>
            
            <p>So the result will be that, every time a user searches for <code>banana</code> we&#39;ll
            get our entry updated.</p>
            
            <p>There is more: our goal is to just have items searched very frequently.
            So we need some form of purging. When we actually query the index
            in order to complete the user input, we may see something like that:</p>
            
            <pre><code>ZRANGEBYLEX myindex &quot;[banana:&quot; + LIMIT 1 10&#x000A;1) &quot;banana:123&quot;&#x000A;2) &quot;banahhh:1&quot;&#x000A;3) &quot;banned user:49&quot;&#x000A;4) &quot;banning:89&quot;&#x000A;</code></pre>
            
            <p>Apparently nobody searches for &quot;banahhh&quot;, for example, but the query was
            performed a single time, so we end presenting it to the user.</p>
            
            <p>This is what we can do. Out of the returned items, we pick a random one,
            decrement its score by one, and re-add it with the new score.
            However if the score reaches 0, we simply remove the item from the list.
            You can use much more advanced systems, but the idea is that the index in
            the long run will contain top searches, and if top searches will change over
            the time it will adapt automatically.</p>
            
            <p>A refinement to this algorithm is to pick entries in the list according to
            their weight: the higher the score, the less likely entries are picked
            in order to decrement its score, or evict them.</p>

            <p>In the completion examples we always used lowercase strings. However
            reality is much more complex than that: languages have capitalized names,
            accents, and so forth.</p>
            
            <p>One simple way do deal with this issues is to actually normalize the
            string the user searches. Whatever the user searches for &quot;Banana&quot;,
            &quot;BANANA&quot; or &quot;Ba&#39;nana&quot; we may always turn it into &quot;banana&quot;.</p>
            
            <p>However sometimes we may like to present the user with the original
            item typed, even if we normalize the string for indexing. In order to
            do this, what we do is to change the format of the index so that instead
            of just storing <code>term:frequency</code> we store <code>normalized:frequency:original</code>
            like in the following example:</p>
            
            <pre><code>ZADD myindex 0 banana:273:Banana&#x000A;</code></pre>
            
            <p>Basically we add another field that we&#39;ll extract and use only for
            visualization. Ranges will always be computed using the normalized strings
            instead. This is a common trick which has multiple applications.</p>
            
            <span id="adding-auxiliary-information-in-the-index" class=anchor></span><h2 ><a href="#adding-auxiliary-information-in-the-index" class=anchor-link>*</a>Adding auxiliary information in the index</h2>
            
            <p>When using a sorted set in a direct way, we have two different attributes
            for each object: the score, which we use as an index, and an associated
            value. When using lexicographical indexes instead, the score is always
            set to 0 and basically not used at all. We are left with a single string,
            which is the element itself.</p>
            
            <p>Like we did in the previous completion examples, we are still able to
            store associated data using separators. For example we used the colon in
            order to add the frequency and the original word for completion.</p>
            
            <p>In general we can add any kind of associated value to our indexing key.
            In order to use a lexicographical index to implement a simple key-value store
            we just store the entry as <code>key:value</code>:</p>
            
            <pre><code>ZADD myindex 0 mykey:myvalue&#x000A;</code></pre>
            
            <p>And search for the key with:</p>
            
            <pre><code>ZRANGEBYLEX myindex mykey: + LIMIT 1 1&#x000A;1) &quot;mykey:myvalue&quot;&#x000A;</code></pre>
            
            <p>Then we extract the part after the colon to retrieve the value.
            However a problem to solve in this case is collisions. The colon character
            may be part of the key itself, so it must be chosen in order to never
            collide with the key we add.</p>
            
            <p>Since lexicographical ranges in Redis are binary safe you can use any
            byte or any sequence of bytes. However if you receive untrusted user
            input, it is better to use some form of escaping in order to guarantee
            that the separator will never happen to be part of the key.</p>
            
            <p>For example if you use two null bytes as separator <code>&quot;\0\0&quot;</code>, you may
            want to always escape null bytes into two bytes sequences in your strings.</p>
            
            <span id="numerical-padding" class=anchor></span><h2 ><a href="#numerical-padding" class=anchor-link>*</a>Numerical padding</h2>
            
            <p>Lexicographical indexes may look like good only when the problem at hand
            is to index strings. Actually it is very simple to use this kind of index
            in order to perform indexing of arbitrary precision numbers.</p>
            
            <p>In the ASCII character set, digits appear in the order from 0 to 9, so
            if we left-pad numbers with leading zeroes, the result is that comparing
            them as strings will order them by their numerical value.</p>
            
            <pre><code>ZADD myindex 0 00324823481:foo&#x000A;ZADD myindex 0 12838349234:bar&#x000A;ZADD myindex 0 00000000111:zap&#x000A;&#x000A;ZRANGE myindex 0 -1&#x000A;1) &quot;00000000111:zap&quot;&#x000A;2) &quot;00324823481:foo&quot;&#x000A;3) &quot;12838349234:bar&quot;&#x000A;</code></pre>
            
            <p>We effectively created an index using a numerical field which can be as
            big as we want. This also works with floating point numbers of any precision
            by making sure we left pad the numerical part with leading zeroes and the
            decimal part with trailing zeroes like in the following list of numbers:</p>
            
            <pre><code>    01000000000000.11000000000000&#x000A;    01000000000000.02200000000000&#x000A;    00000002121241.34893482930000&#x000A;    00999999999999.00000000000000&#x000A;</code></pre>
            
            <span id="using-numbers-in-binary-form" class=anchor></span><h2 ><a href="#using-numbers-in-binary-form" class=anchor-link>*</a>Using numbers in binary form</h2>
            
            <p>Storing numbers in decimal may use too much memory. An alternative approach
            is just to store numbers, for example 128 bit integers, directly in their
            binary form. However for this to work, you need to store the numbers in
            <em>big endian format</em>, so that the most significant bytes are stored before
            the least significant bytes. This way when Redis compares the strings with
            <code>memcmp()</code>, it will effectively sort the numbers by their value.</p>
            
            <p>Keep in mind that data stored in binary format is less observable for
            debugging, harder to parse and export. So it is definitely a trade off.</p>
            
            <span id="composite-indexes" class=anchor></span><h1 ><a href="#composite-indexes" class=anchor-link>*</a>Composite indexes</h1>
            
            <p>So far we explored ways to index single fields. However we all know that
            SQL stores are able to create indexes using multiple fields. For example
            I may index products in a very large store by room number and price.</p>
            
            <p>I need to run queries in order to retrieve all the products in a given
            room having a given price range. What I can do is to index each product
            in the following way:</p>
            
            <pre><code>ZADD myindex 0 0056:0028.44:90&#x000A;ZADD myindex 0 0034:0011.00:832&#x000A;</code></pre>
            
            <p>Here the fields are <code>room:price:product_id</code>. I used just four digits padding
            in the example for simplicity. The auxiliary data (the product ID) does not
            need any padding.</p>
            
            <p>With an index like that, to get all the products in room 56 having a price
            between 10 and 30 dollars is very easy. We can just run the following
            command:</p>
            
            <pre><code>ZRANGEBYLEX myindex [0056:0010.00 [0056:0030.00&#x000A;</code></pre>
            
            <p>The above is called a composed index. Its effectiveness depends on the
            order of the fields and the queries I want to run. For example the above
            index cannot be used efficiently in order to get all the products having
            a specific price range regardless of the room number. However I can use
            the primary key in order to run queries regardless of the price, like
            <em>give me all the products in room 44</em>.</p>
            
            <p>Composite indexes are very powerful, and are used in traditional stores
            in order to optimize complex queries. In Redis they could be useful both
            to implement a very fast in-memory Redis index of something stored into
            a traditional data store, or in order to directly index Redis data.</p>
            
            <span id="updating-lexicographical-indexes" class=anchor></span><h1 ><a href="#updating-lexicographical-indexes" class=anchor-link>*</a>Updating lexicographical indexes</h1>
            
            <p>The value of the index in a lexicographical index can get pretty fancy
            and hard or slow to rebuild from what we store about the object. So one
            approach to simplify the handling of the index, at the cost of using more
            memory, is to also take alongside to the sorted set representing the index
            a hash mapping the object ID to the current index value.</p>
            
            <p>So for example, when we index we also add to a hash:</p>
            
            <pre><code>MULTI&#x000A;ZADD myindex 0 0056:0028.44:90&#x000A;HSET index.content 90 0056:0028.44:90&#x000A;EXEC&#x000A;</code></pre>
            
            <p>This is not always needed, but simplifies the operations of updating
            the index. In order to remove the old information we indexed for the object
            ID 90, regardless of the <em>current</em> fields values of the object, we just
            have to retrieve the hash value by object ID and <a href="/commands/zrem">ZREM</a> it in the sorted
            set view.</p>
            
            <span id="representing-and-querying-graphs-using-an-hexastore" class=anchor></span><h1 ><a href="#representing-and-querying-graphs-using-an-hexastore" class=anchor-link>*</a>Representing and querying graphs using an hexastore</h1>
            
            <p>One cool thing about composite indexes is that they are handy in order
            to represent graphs, using a data structure which is called
            <a href="http://www.vldb.org/pvldb/1/1453965.pdf">Hexastore</a>.</p>
            
            <p>The hexastore provides a representation for relations between objects,
            formed by a <em>subject</em>, a <em>predicate</em> and an <em>object</em>.
            A simple relation between objects could be:</p>
            
            <pre><code>antirez is-friend-of matteocollina&#x000A;</code></pre>
            
            <p>In order to represent this relation I can store the following element
            in my lexicographical index:</p>
            
            <pre><code>ZADD myindex 0 spo:antirez:is-friend-of:matteocollina&#x000A;</code></pre>
            
            <p>Note that I prefixed my item with the string <strong>spo</strong>. It means that
            the item represents a subject,predicate,object relation.</p>
            
            <p>In can add 5 more entries for the same relation, but in a different order:</p>
            
            <pre><code>ZADD myindex 0 sop:antirez:matteocollina:is-friend-of&#x000A;ZADD myindex 0 ops:matteocollina:is-friend-of:antirez&#x000A;ZADD myindex 0 osp:matteocollina:antirez:is-friend-of&#x000A;ZADD myindex 0 pso:is-friend-of:antirez:matteocollina&#x000A;ZADD myindex 0 pos:is-friend-of:matteocollina:antirez&#x000A;</code></pre>
            
            <p>Now things start to be interesting, and I can query the graph in many
            different ways. For example, who are all the people <code>antirez</code>
            <em>is friend of</em>?</p>
            
            <pre><code>ZRANGEBYLEX myindex &quot;[spo:antirez:is-friend-of:&quot; &quot;[spo:antirez:is-friend-of:\xff&quot;&#x000A;1) &quot;spo:antirez:is-friend-of:matteocollina&quot;&#x000A;2) &quot;spo:antirez:is-friend-of:wonderwoman&quot;&#x000A;3) &quot;spo:antirez:is-friend-of:spiderman&quot;&#x000A;</code></pre>
            
            <p>Or, what are all the relationships <code>antirez</code> and <code>matteocollina</code> have where
            the first is the subject and the second is the object?</p>
            
            <pre><code>ZRANGEBYLEX myindex &quot;[sop:antirez:matteocollina:&quot; &quot;[sop:antirez:matteocollina:\xff&quot;&#x000A;1) &quot;sop:antirez:matteocollina:is-friend-of&quot;&#x000A;2) &quot;sop:antirez:matteocollina:was-at-conference-with&quot;&#x000A;3) &quot;sop:antirez:matteocollina:talked-with&quot;&#x000A;</code></pre>
            
            <p>By combining different queries, I can ask fancy questions. For example:
            <em>Who are all my friends that, like beer, live in Barcelona, and matteocollina consider friends as well?</em>
            To get this information I start with an <code>spo</code> query to find all the people
            I&#39;m friend with. Then for each result I get I perform an <code>spo</code> query
            to check if they like beer, removing the ones for which I can&#39;t find
            this relation. I do it again to filter by city. Finally I perform an <code>ops</code>
            query to find, of the list I obtained, who is considered friend by
            matteocollina.</p>

            <span id="multi-dimensional-indexes" class=anchor></span><h1 ><a href="#multi-dimensional-indexes" class=anchor-link>*</a>Multi dimensional indexes</h1>
            
            <p>A more complex type of index is an index that allows you to perform queries
            where two or more variables are queried at the same time for specific
            ranges. For example I may have a data set representing persons age and
            salary, and I want to retrieve all the people between 50 and 55 years old
            having a salary between 70000 and 85000.</p>
            
            <p>This query may be performed with a multi column index, but this requires
            us to select the first variable and then scan the second, which means we
            may do a lot more work than needed. It is possible to perform these kinds of
            queries involving multiple variables using different data structures.
            For example, multi-dimensional trees such as <em>k-d trees</em> or <em>r-trees</em> are
            sometimes used. Here we&#39;ll describe a different way to index data into
            multiple dimensions, using a representation trick that allows us to perform
            the query in a very efficient way using Redis lexicographical ranges.</p>
            
            <p>Let&#39;s start by visualizing the problem. In this picture we have points
            in the space, which represent our data samples, where <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> are
            our coordinates. Both variables max value is 400.</p>
            
            <p>The blue box in the picture represents our query. We want all the points
            where <code>x</code> is between 50 and 100, and where <code>y</code> is between 100 and 300.</p>
            
            <p><img src="http://redis.io/images/redisdoc/2idx_0.png" alt="Points in the space"></p>
            
            <p>In order to represent data that makes these kinds of queries fast to perform,
            we start by padding our numbers with 0. So for example imagine we want to
            add the point 10,25 (x,y) to our index. Given that the maximum range in the
            example is 400 we can just pad to three digits, so we obtain:</p>
            
            <pre><code>x = 010&#x000A;y = 025&#x000A;</code></pre>
            
            <p>Now what we do is to interleave the digits, taking the leftmost digit
            in x, and the leftmost digit in y, and so forth, in order to create a single
            number:</p>
            
            <pre><code>001205&#x000A;</code></pre>
            
            <p>This is our index, however in order to more easily reconstruct the original
            representation, if we want (at the cost of space), we may also add the
            original values as additional columns:</p>
            
            <pre><code>001205:10:25&#x000A;</code></pre>
            
            <p>Now, let&#39;s reason about this representation and why it is useful in the
            context of range queries. For example let&#39;s take the center of our blue
            box, which is at <code>x=75</code> and <code>y=200</code>. We can encode this number as we did
            earlier by interleaving the digits, obtaining:</p>
            
            <pre><code>027050&#x000A;</code></pre>
            
            <p>What happens if we substitute the last two digits respectively with 00 and 99?
            We obtain a range which is lexicographically continuous:</p>
            
            <pre><code>027000 to 027099&#x000A;</code></pre>
            
            <p>What this maps to is to a square representing all values where the <code>x</code>
            variable is between 70 and 79, and the <code>y</code> variable is between 200 and 209.
            We can write random points in this interval, in order to identify this
            specific area:</p>
            
            <p><img src="http://redis.io/images/redisdoc/2idx_1.png" alt="Small area"></p>
            
            <p>So the above lexicographic query allows us to easily query for points in
            a specific square in the picture. However the square may be too small for
            the box we are searching, so that too many queries are needed.
            So we can do the same but instead of replacing the last two digits with 00
            and 99, we can do it for the last four digits, obtaining the following
            range:</p>
            
            <pre><code>020000 029999&#x000A;</code></pre>
            
            <p>This time the range represents all the points where <code>x</code> is between 0 and 99
            and <code>y</code> is between 200 and 299. Drawing random points in this interval
            shows us this larger area:</p>
            
            <p><img src="http://redis.io/images/redisdoc/2idx_2.png" alt="Large area"></p>
            
            <p>Oops now our area is ways too big for our query, and still our search box is
            not completely included. We need more granularity, but we can easily obtain
            it by representing our numbers in binary form. This time, when we replace
            digits instead of getting squares which are ten times bigger, we get squares
            which are just two times bigger.</p>
            
            <p>Our numbers in binary form, assuming we need just 9 bits for each variable
            (in order to represent numbers up to 400 in value) would be:</p>
            
            <pre><code>x = 75  -&gt; 001001011&#x000A;y = 200 -&gt; 011001000&#x000A;</code></pre>
            
            <p>So by interleaving digits, our representation in the index would be:</p>
            
            <pre><code>000111000011001010:75:200&#x000A;</code></pre>
            
            <p>Let&#39;s see what are our ranges as we substitute the last 2, 4, 6, 8, ...
            bits with 0s ad 1s in the interleaved representation:</p>
            
            <pre><code>2 bits: x between 70 and 75, y between 200 and 201 (range=2)&#x000A;4 bits: x between 72 and 75, y between 200 and 203 (range=4)&#x000A;6 bits: x between 72 and 79, y between 200 and 207 (range=8)&#x000A;8 bits: x between 64 and 79, y between 192 and 207 (range=16)&#x000A;</code></pre>
            
            <p>And so forth. Now we have definitely better granularity!
            As you can see substituting N bits from the index gives us
            search boxes of side <code>2^(N/2)</code>.</p>
            
            <p>So what we do is check the dimension where our search box is smaller,
            and check the nearest power of two to this number. Our search box
            was 50,100 to 100,300, so it has a width of 50 and an height of 200.
            We take the smaller of the two, 50, and check the nearest power of two
            which is 64. 64 is 2<sup>6,</sup> so we would work with indexes obtained replacing
            the latest 12 bits from the interleaved representation (so that we end
            replacing just 6 bits of each variable).</p>
            
            <p>However single squares may not cover all our search, so we may need more.
            What we do is to start with the left bottom corner of our search box,
            which is 50,100, and find the first range by substituting the last 6 bits
            in each number with 0. Then we do the same with the right top corner.</p>
            
            <p>With two trivial nested for loops where we increment only the significant
            bits, we can find all the squares between these two. For each square we
            convert the two numbers into our interleaved representation, and create
            the range using the converted representation as our start, and the same
            representation but with the latest 12 bits turned on as end range.</p>
            
            <p>For each square found we perform our query and get the elements inside,
            removing the elements which are outside our search box.</p>
            
            <p>Turning this into code is simple. Here is a Ruby example:</p>
            
            <pre><code>def spacequery(x0,y0,x1,y1,exp)&#x000A;    bits=exp*2&#x000A;    x_start = x0/(2**exp)&#x000A;    x_end = x1/(2**exp)&#x000A;    y_start = y0/(2**exp)&#x000A;    y_end = y1/(2**exp)&#x000A;    (x_start..x_end).each{|x|&#x000A;        (y_start..y_end).each{|y|&#x000A;            x_range_start = x*(2**exp)&#x000A;            x_range_end = x_range_start | ((2**exp)-1)&#x000A;            y_range_start = y*(2**exp)&#x000A;            y_range_end = y_range_start | ((2**exp)-1)&#x000A;            puts &quot;#{x},#{y} x from #{x_range_start} to #{x_range_end}, y from #{y_range_start} to #{y_range_end}&quot;&#x000A;&#x000A;            # Turn it into interleaved form for ZRANGEBYLEX query.&#x000A;            # We assume we need 9 bits for each integer, so the final&#x000A;            # interleaved representation will be 18 bits.&#x000A;            xbin = x_range_start.to_s(2).rjust(9,&#39;0&#39;)&#x000A;            ybin = y_range_start.to_s(2).rjust(9,&#39;0&#39;)&#x000A;            s = xbin.split(&quot;&quot;).zip(ybin.split(&quot;&quot;)).flatten.compact.join(&quot;&quot;)&#x000A;            # Now that we have the start of the range, calculate the end&#x000A;            # by replacing the specified number of bits from 0 to 1.&#x000A;            e = s[0..-(bits+1)]+(&quot;1&quot;*bits)&#x000A;            puts &quot;ZRANGEBYLEX myindex [#{s} [#{e}&quot;&#x000A;        }&#x000A;    }&#x000A;end&#x000A;&#x000A;spacequery(50,100,100,300,6)&#x000A;</code></pre>
            
            <p>While non immediately trivial this is a very useful indexing strategy that
            in the future may be implemented in Redis in a native way.
            For now, the good thing is that the complexity may be easily encapsulated
            inside a library that can be used in order to perform indexing and queries.
            One example of such library is <a href="https://github.com/antirez/redimension">Redimension</a>, a proof of concept Ruby library which indexes N-dimensional data inside Redis using the technique described here.</p>
            
            <span id="multi-dimensional-indexes-with-negative-or-floating-point-numbers" class=anchor></span><h1 ><a href="#multi-dimensional-indexes-with-negative-or-floating-point-numbers" class=anchor-link>*</a>Multi dimensional indexes with negative or floating point numbers</h1>
            
            <p>The simplest way to represent negative values is just to work with unsigned
            integers and represent them using an offset, so that when you index, before
            translating numbers in the indexed representation, you add the absolute value
            of your smaller negative integer.</p>
            
            <p>For floating point numbers, the simplest approach is probably to convert them
            to integers by multiplying the integer for a power of ten proportional to the
            number of digits after the dot you want to retain.</p>
            
            <span id="non-range-indexes" class=anchor></span><h1 ><a href="#non-range-indexes" class=anchor-link>*</a>Non range indexes</h1>
            
            <p>So far we checked indexes which are useful to query by range or by single
            item. However other Redis data structures such as Sets or Lists can be used
            in order to build other kind of indexes. They are very commonly used but
            maybe we don&#39;t always realize they are actually a form of indexing.</p>
            
            <p>For instance I can index object IDs into a Set data type in order to use
            the <em>get random elements</em> operation via <a href="/commands/srandmember">SRANDMEMBER</a> in order to retrieve
            a set of random objects. Sets can also be used to check for existence when
            all I need is to test if a given item exists or not or has a single boolean
            property or not.</p>
            
            <p>Similarly lists can be used in order to index items into a fixed order.
            I can add all my items into a Redis list and rotate the list with
            RPOPLPUSH using the same key name as source and destination. This is useful
            when I want to process a given set of items again and again forever in the
            same order. Think of an RSS feed system that needs to refresh the local copy
            periodically.</p>
            
            <p>Another popular index often used with Redis is a <strong>capped list</strong>, where items
            are added with <a href="/commands/lpush">LPUSH</a> and trimmed with <a href="/commands/ltrim">LTRIM</a>, in order to create a view
            with just the latest N items encountered, in the same order they were
            seen.</p>
            
            <span id="index-inconsistency" class=anchor></span><h1 ><a href="#index-inconsistency" class=anchor-link>*</a>Index inconsistency</h1>
            
            <p>Keeping the index updated may be challenging, in the course of months
            or years it is possible that inconsistencies are added because of software
            bugs, network partitions or other events.</p>
            
            <p>Different strategies could be used. If the index data is outside Redis
            <em>read repair</em> can be a solution, where data is fixed in a lazy way when
            it is requested. When we index data which is stored in Redis itself
            the <a href="/commands/scan">SCAN</a> family of commands can be used in order to verify, update or
            rebuild the index from scratch, incrementally.</p>
